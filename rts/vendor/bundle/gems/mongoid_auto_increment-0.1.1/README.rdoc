= Mongoid::AutoIncrement

Add SQL like auto-incrementing fields to your Mongoid documents.
This gem is inspired by http://ihswebdesign.com/blog/autoincrement-in-mongodb-with-ruby/ and the mongomapper_id2[https://github.com/phstc/mongomapper_id2] gem.

== Installation

Add to Gemfile:

    gem 'mongoid_auto_increment'

== Getting Started

Just add <tt>auto_increment :field</tt> to your Mongoid model where <tt>:field</tt> is the name of the auto-incremented field you want to create.
Example:

    class Book
      include Mongoid::Document

      field :title
      field :author

      auto_increment :sequence
    end

<tt>auto_increment :sequence</tt> will create a field of type <tt>Integer</tt> named <tt>sequence</tt> for <tt>Book</tt>.  Whenever an instance of the model is created (intially saved to mongoDB), the <tt>auto_increment</tt> field will automatically be set to the next number in the sequence.

You can add more than one auto-incremented field per model.

=== Options

    auto_increment :sequence, :collection => :some_collection

<tt>mongoid_auto_inc</tt> keeps track of the current number in the sequence by creating a separate document mongoDB to query and update.  By default <tt>auto_increment</tt> will save this document to a mongoDB collection called <tt>sequences</tt>.  If you wish to save to a different collection use the <tt>:collection</tt> option to specify its name.

    auto_increment :sequence, :step => 5

If desired, you can override the <tt>:step</tt>, or increment amount (default is 1).

    auto_increment :sequence, :seed => 3333

Use the <tt>:seed</tt> option to set the initial value of the auto-incremented field.  The first number assigned from the sequence will be the next number after the seed value (including the step - so for <tt>:seed => 1000, :step => 5</tt>, first value will be 1005).

== Contributing to Mongoid::AutoIncrement

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
