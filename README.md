GETTING STARTED RAILS 4 WITH MONGODB
April 26, 2013 · by Emiliano Zilocchi · in Rails
Introduction
The idea is to create a Ruby on Rails application  from scratch, that connects with MongoDB. The gems involve are:

   * MongoID:  To integrate Rails and MongoDB
   * Slim: An alternative template engine to ERB (the Rails default one).
   * Rspec: A BDD gem to express the tests as specifications
   * Cucumber: A BBD gem to express the acceptance tests in Gherkin Syntax

NOTE:  You can find the source code for this tutorial here
Technology Stack

   * MongoDB
   * Ruby
   * Rails
   * GIT (Optional)
   * VIM (Optional)

Create a rails app without active record and test unit 
Since we are using MongoDB, a NoSQL database, we don’t need ActiveRecord, so we can use the option–skip-active-record in order to avoid the creation of all the files and configuration related.
In the same way, we want to use Rspec and Cucumber for automation testing, so we can omit the Unit Test installation as well with the option --skip-test-unit

rails new myapp --skip-active-record --skip-test-unit
Installing MongoID gem
Open the Gemfile and add the dependency gem “mongoid”* and then run bundle install
Finally run


rails generate mongoid:config
Now any time that you run a generate command that involves models creation it will invoke MongoID instead of ActiveRecord.
*NOTE: At the time of writing this blog the lastest release for MongoID (3.0.5) is not compatible with Rails 4, so you have to use the master version instead:


+gem'mongoid', git:'git://github.com/mongoid/mongoid.git'
Installing Slim gem
Open the Gemfile and add the gem dependency: gem “slim-rails” and run bundle install
Now any time that you run a generate command that involves template creation it will use Slim instead of ERB.
Installing Rspec gem
One more time we add the dependency:

+group :testdo
+  gem"rspec-rails"
+end
And then run:

rails generate rspec:install
Since we are using MongoID and not ActiveRecord, you need to comment these two lines from spec/spec_helper.rb:


# Remove this line if you're not using ActiveRecord or ActiveRecord fixtures
-  config.fixture_path ="#{::Rails.root}/spec/fixtures"
+  # config.fixture_path = "#{::Rails.root}/spec/fixtures"
# If you're not using ActiveRecord, or you'd prefer not to run each of your
# examples within a transaction, remove the following line or assign false
# instead of true.
-  config.use_transactional_fixtures =true
+  # config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
Installing Cucumber gem
Again we add the dependency:


+group :testdo
+  gem'cucumber-rails', :require =>false
+  gem'database_cleaner'
+end
And the command to install it:

rails generate cucumber:install
Since we are using MongoID and not ActiveRecord, you need to change the database cleaner strategy from transaction to truncation in features/support/env.rb:

-  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
+  DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
Let’s create some entities
To show the impact of these gems in a standar generate command, let see what has changed

rails generate scaffold product name description price:float

invoke  mongoid
create    app/models/product.rb
invoke  resource_route
route    resources :products
invoke  jbuilder_scaffold_controller
create    app/controllers/products_controller.rb
invoke    slim
create      app/views/products
create      app/views/products/index.html.slim
create      app/views/products/edit.html.slim
create      app/views/products/show.html.slim
create      app/views/products/new.html.slim
create      app/views/products/_form.html.slim
invoke    helper
create      app/helpers/products_helper.rb
invoke    jbuilder
exist      app/views/products
create      app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder
create      app/views/products/show.json.jbuilder
invoke  assets
invoke    coffee
create      app/assets/javascripts/products.js.coffee
invoke    scss
create      app/assets/stylesheets/products.css.scss
invoke  scss
create    app/assets/stylesheets/scaffolds.css.scss
This is the command output, let’s see what has changed from the default onw:

   * views: We are invoking slim so we are generating slim extension instead of erb.
   * db: We are not generating migrations. Since MongoDB is a schemaless database, we don’t need to create tables.
   * model: We are invoking mongoid now, so we are creating models prepared to work with Mongo:

+class Product
+  include Mongoid::Document
+  field :name,type: String
+  field :description,type: String
+  field :price,type: Float
+end
